# declutter-life
There are always things you repeatedly do that you wish somebody else can do it for you. This repo is trying to tackle down a few things I hate do every time. 

## finance
- how much I spend this week and this month? 
## health 
- how much times I workout this week and this month?
- what foods I've eaten? 
- what to eat for next week?
 
 ## book 
 - what books I should read next time?
 - what is the progress I have had this week and this month?
